Me trying to make a neuron network

The program in (Traning) file will take inputs and outputs as traning data , and you choose how many layers there should be and the number of the times it will train and aventually it will generate the least error and output the brain data that you can plug into the (Testing) file to see how the brain performs agenst your inputs

it's still in progress
